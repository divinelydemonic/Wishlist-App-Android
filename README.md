# 🏗 Architecture

The app follows **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architecture with a clean separation of concerns.

### 📌 Layers:
- **UI (Compose)** → Displays data & handles user interaction  
- **ViewModel** → Business logic & state management  
- **Repository** → Data abstraction layer  
- **Room (DAO + DB)** → Local data storage
